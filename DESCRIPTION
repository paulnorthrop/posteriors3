Description: Provides functions to perform univariate Bayesian analyses using
    the S3 probability distribution objects provided by the 'distributions3' 
    package <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.distributions3>. A multiplication 
    generic function is provided so that a posterior distribution object can be 
    created from a product of a likelihood object and a prior distribution 
    object. Therefore, the code mimics the mathematics that students encounter 
    when learning about Bayesian inference. If a conjugate prior is used then 
    the posterior distribution object is also an S3 probability distribution 
    object. If the prior is non-conjugate then the 'rust' package 
    <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.rust> is used to simulate from the posterior 
    distribution. Example cases binomial and normal likelihoods are provided.
